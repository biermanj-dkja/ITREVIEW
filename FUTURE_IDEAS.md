# Future Ideas

Ideas captured during development. Not prioritised — reference for future roadmap conversations.

---

## Reporting & Visualisation

- **Graphical calendar view** — visual Gantt-style calendar for the phased remediation timeline,
  rendered in the browser or embedded in the DOCX. Deferred from v0.4 timeline implementation.
- **Executive / board report variant** — shorter, less technical version of the DOCX focused
  on key risks, scores, and the Phase 1 summary. No per-finding detail.
- **Anonymous benchmarking** — opt-in submission of score data (no PII, no school name) to
  build an aggregate benchmark database. Allow schools to see how they compare to similar
  institutions by size or type.

## UI / UX

- **Dark mode toggle** — the UI is already dark-themed; add a light mode option for users who prefer it.
- **Logo upload** — allow school to upload a logo that appears on the DOCX cover page.
- **JS dynamic conditionals** — move gate/cascade logic from server-side YAML evaluation to
  client-side JavaScript so question visibility updates instantly without a page reload.
- **Deprecate server-rendered UI** — longer term, replace Flask templates with a modern
  JS frontend (React or HTMX) for a snappier experience.

## Scoring & Assessment

- **User-editable score adjustment** — allow the reviewer to override a finding's severity
  after the fact (e.g. "we fixed this last week") with an audit trail.
- **Module 2, 3…** — expand beyond Module 1 (small private school) to cover other institution
  types: public K-12, higher ed, multi-site districts.
- **Re-assessment tracking** — store multiple assessment snapshots per school and show
  score deltas over time ("you improved Section 7 by 18 points since last review").

## Operations

- **Email delivery** — send the DOCX directly to a specified address after generation.
- **PDF export** — generate a PDF version in addition to (or instead of) DOCX for easier
  sharing with non-Word users.
- **Multi-user sessions** — allow multiple people to collaborate on the same assessment
  (e.g. IT director fills sections 2–4, principal fills section 1).
